# Project ideas

## Replication
Build a known, but not available attack (TPM attacks, SGX attacks, etc)

## Enclave application development
* Implement an application for running on a remote enclave
  * ML
  * Database
  * Simple multiplayer game (anti-cheat)

## Hardware enclave development
* Keystone Project (with Dayeol/David)
  * Formal verification techniques
  * PMP integration work
* Isolated architectures
  * Open questions: isolation of memory addresses, workload scheduling, etc



## Implement attacks
* Replication
* Spectre-style attacks on BOOM (or other non-standard out-of-order cores)
* FPGA state recovery attack (See David)
* Hostile TPM attack (See David)
* 32-bit SGX (See SGX Explained paper)
